# eventAbility

This program utilizes Google Firebase, Geocode API, GoogleMaps API, FourSquare API and allows users to find an event located near them based on the day, their interests and range they're willing to travel.

Once all inputs have been entered, 50 populated results will be stored within the program but will show one event at a time. If the user is not appeased with the event, they are welcome to search the result until they find one.
